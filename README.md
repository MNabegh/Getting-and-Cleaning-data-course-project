# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-course-project

## Overview:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the original data for the project:

The original data comes with a README.txt file that explains how it has been collected, howevever, this is out of the scope of this project. As, this project aims to provide a tidy dataset with some summary statstics from the original messy dataset.

The required tasks in this project are:
- Provide an R script that download and tidy the original dataset.
- Provide a code book for the data set.
- Write the tidy dataset to a file.
